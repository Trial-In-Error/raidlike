To do and other general notes:
* line of sight
* re-route creatures on 'cannot move; other creatures in way' instead of current mode of waiting(1 quantum)
* diagonal movement
* diagonal AI pathing
* enemy polymorphism
    * differing time quantum costs by player/enemy type
* __string__ repr's for all entity children, grid, and timeLine
* inventory & item management
* color output?
*"look" parsing mode
