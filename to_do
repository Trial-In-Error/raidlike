To do and other general notes:

IMPORTANT:
* camera off-set
* level load from text
* migrate colorDict & extend to type

LOOK HAS A BUG; COSTS TIME T___T
WALLS: WRAP AROUND SCARINESS

NEW FEATURES:
* line of sight
    * differing time quantum costs by player/enemy type
* level input parser
* cell.drawContents() for drawing multiple things (color backgrounds)

TWEAKING:
* relative camera-drawing
* overhaul grid to use cells
* "look" parsing mode
    * needs to enter description mode and cleanly exit it, too
        * shallow look vs. deep look
    * does not support escape to leave
    * enable diagonals!
        * protect against level edges!
* re-route creatures on 'cannot move; other creatures in way' instead of current mode of waiting(1 quantum)
* diagonal AI pathing
    *ASTAR pathing
* __string__ repr's for all entity children, grid, and timeLine
* inventory & item management
* make 'r'est wait until next quantum with an actor in item
    * make that 'R'est and start differentiating case
* __doc__strings
* test in Windows environment
* split floor from entity
* develop deep look as a separate input parser
* wall collision error text
* clean up grid / cell / levelManager interactions
* grid.clear() using iterators, not double-for-loop
* memory Draw doesn't support drawing enemies from memory

BUGS:
* escape to leave "look" context requires two strokes
