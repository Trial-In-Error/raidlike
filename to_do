To do and other general notes:
* color output?
* broken draw/clear cycle
* "look" parsing mode
    * needs to enter description mode and cleanly exit it, too
        * shallow look vs. deep look
    * does not support escape to leave
* line of sight
    * requires color support (memory vs. present sight)
* re-route creatures on 'cannot move; other creatures in way' instead of current mode of waiting(1 quantum)
* diagonal movement
    * y, home : up-left
    * b, end : down-left
    * u, pgup : up-right
    * n, pgdn : down-right
* diagonal AI pathing
* enemy polymorphism
    * differing time quantum costs by player/enemy type
* __string__ repr's for all entity children, grid, and timeLine
* inventory & item management
* make 'r'est wait until next quantum with an actor in item
    * make that 'R'est and start differentiating case
* __doc__strings

BUGS:
* escape to leave "look" context requires two strokes
