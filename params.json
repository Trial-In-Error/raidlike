{"name":"Raidlike","tagline":"a little game project","body":"## raidlike\r\na game concept largely inspired by dark souls and stone soup. focus will initially be on world-building, player choice, and atmosphere in the context of a rogue-like interface with permanent death. later development will hopefully introduce asynchronous multiplayer.\r\n\r\n### design goals\r\n* opaque mechanics\r\n* persistent character changes\r\n* absence of stat-stick items\r\n* feelings of wonderment and paranoia\r\n* strong sense of world and choice\r\n\r\n### core mechanics\r\nall characters will start as devotees of a god(dess) in the game's pantheon: the character's actions will shape their relationship with their deity and their resulting powers. levels will not be randomly generated, but may contain some random permutations. a large emphasis will be placed on hiding the opportunities within a level to allow for gradual discovery.\r\n\r\n### contact\r\nthe author can be contacted at @Trial-In-Error or tylhandrias@gmail.com.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
